I am an ecologist, and I typically use ESRI programs for all of my professional mapmaking needs.

However, there are so many other ways to make maps!

This blog is my space to explore making maps in free and open-source programs like [R](https://www.rstudio.com/) and [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/).
